< A farming system that uses hypospectural imagining for protein quality detection and hydrogen eletricity to run the irrigation and other energy consuming needs of the farm.
<the data system would be an integrated platform that enables me to see the progress of my plants and their portein levels and the enegry use and consumption and the progress of the actual hydogren battery with solar power/
<this system would then connect me with the overall functioning of the business from logistics, from the field into the the packaging house, enabling a detailed orientation to exist between the functioning of the farm and the daily activities with employees.
< this system would be depend on both greenhoouse operation and open fields. In the greenhouse, it would be automative and the open plan it would generally be more satellite farming etc.
